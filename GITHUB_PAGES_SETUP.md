# üöÄ GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

Your code is pushed and the repository is now public! Follow these simple steps to enable GitHub Pages:

## Step 1: Go to Repository Settings

1. Visit: https://github.com/SillyMFJ/RobloxMonitor/settings/pages
2. Or navigate to: Your Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages (in left sidebar)

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

Under **"Build and deployment"** section:

1. **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** from the dropdown
   - This will use the workflow file we created (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   
2. That's it! No need to click any save button - it auto-saves.

## Step 3: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab: https://github.com/SillyMFJ/RobloxMonitor/actions
2. You should see a workflow running called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to complete (green checkmark ‚úÖ)

## Step 4: Access Your Live Website

Once deployed, your website will be live at:

üåê **https://sillymfj.github.io/RobloxMonitor/**

## Troubleshooting

### If you see a 404 error:
- Wait a few minutes - initial deployment can take 5-10 minutes
- Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in settings
- Check the Actions tab for any failed workflows

### If the workflow doesn't start automatically:
- Go to Actions tab
- Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Click "Run workflow" button

### If you see CORS errors on the live site:
This is expected for production. The Roblox APIs should work directly from the browser without the dev proxy.

## Future Updates

Every time you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site!
